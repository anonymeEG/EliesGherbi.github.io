I am a  researcher at  IRT-SystemX  Institute of research and Technology. Previously, I completed my PhD at IRT-SystemX in collaboration with [IBISC](https://www.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/) Laboratory of the University of Evry and the University of Paris Saclay under the supervision of [Blaise Hanczar](https://sites.google.com/site/bhanczarhomepage/accueil) and [Jean-Christophe](https://www.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/~janodet/) Janodet. During my PhD entitled "Machine Learning for in-vehicle intrusion detection system", the goal was to build a deep learning research framework around intrusion detection systems in high-constraint contexts such as autonomous vehicles against cybersecurity threats.

In my current position, my research aims to identify and fix the Security and Privacy vulnerabilities of Machine Learning systems. In the context of the [Confiance AI program](https://www.confiance.ai/), I have developed a series of certifiably robust defenses and empirical defenses to evaluate the trustworthiness of ML-based critical systems.
