  abstract = 	 {Anomaly detection is a standard problem in Machine Learning with various applications such as health-care, predictive maintenance, and cyber-security. In such applications, the data is unbalanced: the rate of regular examples is much higher than the anomalous examples. The emergence of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has recently brought new algorithms for anomaly detection. Most of them use the generator as a proxy for the reconstruction loss. The idea is that the generator cannot reconstruct an anomaly. We develop an alternative approach for anomaly detection, based on an Encoding Adversarial Network (AnoEAN), which maps the data to a latent space (decision space), where the detection of anomalies is done directly by calculating a score. Our encoder is learned by adversarial learning, using two loss functions, the first constraining the encoder to project regular data into a Gaussian distribution and the second, to project anomalous data outside this distribution. We conduct a series of experiments on several standard bases and show that our approach outperforms the state of the art when using 10% anomalies during the learning stage, and detects unseen anomalies.}

abstract="Modern and future vehicles are complex cyber-physical systems. The connection to their outside environment raises many security problems that impact our safety directly. In this work, we propose a Deep CAN intrusion detection system framework. We introduce a multivariate time series representation for asynchronous CAN data which enhances the temporal modelling of deep learning architectures for anomaly detection. We study different deep learning tasks (supervised/unsupervised) and compare several architectures, in order to design an in-vehicle intrusion detection system that fits in-vehicle computational constraints. We conduct experiments with many types of attacks on an in-vehicle CAN using SynCAn Dataset.",

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
